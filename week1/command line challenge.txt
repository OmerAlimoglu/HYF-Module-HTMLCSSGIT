1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

You should put a dot(.) in front of the file or folder in order to create a hidden one.
In order to display the hidden files or folders you should use command "ls -a".

2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

You should use (-p) tag with mkdir in order to do that. It should be like this; 
mkdir -p dir/{dir1,dir2,dir3} or mkdir -p these/are/just/for/fun

3. Write more than one command that will create a file that looks like the following (you are not allowed to use the newline character (\n)):
first message
second message

For this one you should create a file first. And then add the text inside.
touch somefile.txt


after that you can use;
echo "first message" > somefile.txt 
echo "second message" >> somefile.txt

with this one we can add two line text in our text file.
